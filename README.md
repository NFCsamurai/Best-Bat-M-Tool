    - `token.txt`: Paste your Discord bot/account token inside.
    - `channel_id.txt`: One channel ID per line (where messages will be sent).
3. Use the menu to configure and start messaging.

⚠️ **Do NOT share your Discord bot or account token with others.**  
This script only sends messages to channels your account or bot has access to.
